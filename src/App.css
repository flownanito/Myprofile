/* Add a pseudo-element or extra div if we need the specific margin/background shown in design? 
   The design has a lighter grey/white background outside the dark app. 
   Currently body background is var(--primary-dark).
   Wait, the design image shows a white/grey sidebar on the far left? No, that's just the mockup background.
   The user wants the "home completely identical".
   I will assume the body background should be dark as well, or maybe the user wants the centered look.
   I'll stick to the dark theme for the body for now as 'identical to the home' usually refers to the UI itself.*/
